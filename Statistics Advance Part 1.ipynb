It maps outcomes of a sample space to real numbers.\n","\n","\n","\n","### 2. **What are the types of random variables?**\n","\n","* Discrete Random Variable.\n","* Continuous Random Variable.\n","\n","\n","\n","### 3. **What is the difference between discrete and continuous distributions?**\n","\n","* **Discrete distributions** represent outcomes of discrete random variables (e.g., binomial, Poisson).\n","* **Continuous distributions** represent outcomes of continuous variables (e.g., normal, exponential).\n","\n","\n","\n","### 4. **What are probability distribution functions (PDF)?**\n","\n","PDFs describe the likelihood of a random variable to take a specific value. For continuous variables, it represents the only density at a point.\n","\n","\n","\n","### 5. **How do cumulative distribution functions (CDF) differ from probability distribution functions (PDF)?**\n","\n","* **PDF** gives the relative likelihood of a value.\n","* **CDF** gives the probability that a variable is less than or equal to a certain value.\n","\n","\n","\n","### 6. **What is a discrete uniform distribution?**\n","\n","A distribution where each possible discrete outcome has an equal probability. Example: Rolling a fair die.\n","\n","\n","\n","### 7. **What are the key properties of a Bernoulli distribution?**\n","\n","* Two possible outcomes: success (1) or failure (0).\n","* Defined by a single parameter $p$, the probability of success.\n","* Mean = $p$, Variance = $p(1 - p)$.\n","\n","\n","\n","### 8. **What is the binomial distribution, and how is it used in probability?**\n","\n","It models the number of successes in $n$ independent Bernoulli trials with probability $p$ of success. Used in quality control, genetics, etc.\n","\n","\n","\n","### 9. **What is the Poisson distribution and where is it applied?**\n","\n","Models the number of times an event occurs in a fixed interval (time/space), given a known average rate $\\lambda$. Common in queuing theory and traffic analysis.\n","\n","\n","\n","### 10. **What is a continuous uniform distribution?**\n","\n","All outcomes in a continuous range have equal probability. Example: Random number generator in \\[0,1].\n","\n","\n","\n","### 11. **What are the characteristics of a normal distribution?**\n","\n","* Bell-shaped, symmetric about the mean.\n","* Defined by mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$.\n","* Follows empirical rule: 68%-95%-99.7%.\n","\n","\n","\n","### 12. **What is the standard normal distribution, and why is it important?**\n","\n","A normal distribution with $\\mu = 0$ and $\\sigma = 1$. It's the reference for calculating Z-scores and performing hypothesis tests.\n","\n","\n","\n","### 13. **What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and why is it critical in statistics?**\n","\n","It states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as sample size increases, regardless of the population's distribution. Critical for making inferences.\n","\n","\n","\n","### 14. **How does the Central Limit Theorem relate to the normal distribution?**\n","\n","It explains why normal distribution is used in practice: sample means tend to be normally distributed due to the CLT, even if the population is not.\n","\n","\n","\n","### 15. **What is the application of Z statistics in hypothesis testing?**\n","\n","Z-statistics help determine if a sample mean significantly differs from a known population mean, especially when population variance is known.\n","\n","\n","\n","### 16. **How do you calculate a Z-score, and what does it represent?**\n","\n","$$\n","Z = \\frac{(X - \\mu)}{\\sigma}\n","$$\n","\n","It represents how many standard deviations an observation $X$ is from the mean $\\mu$.\n","\n","\n","\n","### 17. **What are point estimates and interval estimates in statistics?**\n","\n","* **Point Estimate**: Single value estimate (e.g., sample mean).\n","* **Interval Estimate**: Range likely to contain the population parameter (e.g., confidence interval).\n","\n","\n","\n","### 18. **What is the significance of confidence intervals in statistical analysis?**\n","\n","They provide a range of values for the population parameter and help quantify uncertainty in estimates.\n","\n","\n","\n","### 19. **What is the relationship between a Z-score and a confidence interval?**\n","\n","Confidence intervals are calculated using Z-scores for known confidence levels (e.g., Z = 1.96 for 95%).\n","\n","\n","\n","### 20. **How are Z-scores used to compare different distributions?**\n","\n","Z-scores standardize values from different distributions, allowing comparison across scales by measuring relative positions.\n","\n","\n","\n","### 21. **What are the assumptions for applying the Central Limit Theorem?**\n","\n","* Independent observations\n","* Identically distributed samples\n","* Finite variance\n","* Large enough sample size (typically $n \\geq 30$)\n","\n","\n","\n","### 22. **What is the concept of expected value in a probability distribution?**\n","\n","It is the weighted average of all possible values a random variable can take:\n","\n","$$\n","E(X) = \\sum x \\cdot P(x) \\text{ (discrete)} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad E(X) = \\int x f(x) dx \\text{ (continuous)}\n","$$\n","\n","\n","\n","### 23. **How does a probability distribution relate to the expected outcome of a random variable?**\n","\n","The expected value is derived from the probability distribution and represents the long-run average outcome of the random variable.\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"C1pYAh_Johwg"}}]}
